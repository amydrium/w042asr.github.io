							<h2>Genius Hour Introduction</h2>
							<p>Genius Hour is the chance for young minds to research whatever they want. It allows us as
							middle schoolers to learn about a specific driving question. It's an opportunity to become the "genius"
							of a preferred topic and present it to your class. The idea is that when a student/employee has time
							to work on personal projects, productivity increases. For us, Genius Hour is that time.
							The project is thought to have begun when Google began allowing employees 20% of their time on personal projects.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

							<h2>Project Background</h2>
							<p>I took this opportunity to build my own business. I've always been interested in the "professional"
							aspects of being an artist, and in general, how to build a large following. I want to work in an 
							artistic field when I grow up, so I wanted to research how a young artist, such as myself, would
							get started in the art industry. I started by observing what's popular as a business platform,
							and the answer was social media. It's a way for people to connect with their communities,
							and for businesses to advertise and sell products. From this, as well as from experience,
							I decided to research <strong>how social media can help young artists create a brand for themselves.</strong></p>
						</div>
					</div>					
					<div class='row'>
						<div class='column'>
							<h2>Research</h2>
							<p>To answer this question, I've decided to create my own social media account to track follower growth
							and commission inquiries after a week of posting artwork and advertising on other platforms. I've
							decided to use Instagram for my research, as there is a thriving art community within it. My demographic
							was teenage artists; I figured Instagram would have the sort of people I'm looking for. </p>
							
							<p>I researched strategies that small businesses use to build audiences and sell products on social media, and I've
							listed some below.</p>
							
							<ul>
								<li>Choose only a few platforms.</li>
								<li>Use consistent imagery and naming across accounts.</li>
								<li>Interact with your audience! Reply to comments, like posts, etc.</li>
								<li>Use hashtags to sort posts or bring attention to them.</li>
								<li>Know your demographic.</li>
								<li>Bring attention to your content by hosting giveaways, etc.</li>
								<li>Never upload the full-resolution version of artwork.</li>
								<li>Always upload 500px-wide signed PNG file, because it loads much faster, and makes it
								harder to potentially steal. However, lowering the resolution can cause artifacts to appear.</li>
								<li>Create a professional online portfolio to showcase your art.</li>
								<li>Use a service like Iconosquare to track progress.</li>
							</ul>

							<p style="padding:2%;"><b>Pictured Above: A request I completed before the project began. This was my second post, and it gained
							10 likes by the end of my data collection period.</b></p>
							<p><b>Tip:</b> When posting art online,
							you may be told to watermark artwork, but <em>please</em> don't.
							The intention of watermarks is to prevent theft, but that is ineffective. They can
							be easily removed by anyone who has a basic knowledge of Photoshop. Instead,
							provide a link/username to your profile/portfolio and sign it. Through
							Photoshop, you can also copyright your files.</p>

							<p>My goal in this project was to

							Below you can see the data from my experience on social media.</p>

							<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				
							<p>
								After five days of experiments, I feel like I can say that my strategies worked pretty well. 
								On my first day, I told everyone on every platform I use that I started an art-based Instagram page,
								I tagged relevant niches to bring attention to my work, I used good-quality photos, and I gave background information on my work.
								These strategies brought me 10 likes within a few hours. I used similar strategies for each of my posts,
								generating a total of 11 followers over a five day period and 58 total likes. I found that fantasy art and fan art are easy niches to 
								appeal to, because they're relatively small, and are related to my work. Both of these tags attracted many people to my
								page. However, I still use popular tags on my work (like "art"), because it makes it more likely that a gallery/professional artist
								(or, in my case, at least three)
								will find my work. Even with the attention I brought to my work through business strategy, I did not receive a
								single request. To answer my question, how social media helps young artists establish a brand, it helps to
								build an audience and reputation, but it does not assist in sales at such a small scale.
								From this I gather that most of the business strategies work to bring attention to your page,
								but there is no guarantee that it will generate sales. The strategies work to gain a larger following,
								but not to actually attract business. So to use social media effectively, as an artist, I'd recommend
								using social media to establish a gallery, and then use the gallery to link to a business.
