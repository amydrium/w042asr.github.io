							<h2>Interactive Resume in the Unreal Engine</h2>
							
							<p>In October 2021, my Game Design teacher approached me about creating an interactive resume in the Unreal Engine as an example for a lesson he was planning for Epic Games. The Unreal Engine is a free-to-use engine maintained by Epic Games and is used as a base for video games, but it also has other applications; in this case, I used the engine to create a resume. After making the level in the engine, I also created a video overview of my resume, which I have attached to this page. To create the resume, I created 3D models in Blender and created image textures in Adobe Photoshop before importing my work into the Unreal Engine. During this process, I learned how to export 3D models for use in game engines and how to use visual node scripting within the Unreal Engine to achieve specific effects. In total, creating the resume took four weeks. </p>

						  <h2>E-Sports Logo Design</h2>
							 <p>During first semester this year, I was tasked with creating a potential logo design for the DRSS Innovators E-Sports team. I first drafted the logo in Adobe Photoshop, and I then created a vector version of my design; during this project, I learned a lot about vector tools in Adobe Illustrator and how to prepare images for printing. During this experience, I learned more about how to work with clients in the context of graphic design. While I may not pursue graphic design as a career, creating a logo for my school's E-Sports team was a valuable experience and gave me an opportunity to add to my art portfolio.</p>

							<h2>Scholastic Art Competition</h2>
							
							<p>During December 2020, I participated in the 2021 Scholastic Art Competition. To the left, you can see my painting, Scopophobia. Because I won a Gold Key Award for this painting, my painting was considered for judging with competitors nationwide. My work was held at an exhibition at the K12 Gallery &amp; TEJAS in Dayton in February 2021, where I received my reward and gave an interview.</p>

							<h2>Merchandise Design</h2>
							
							<p>During the summer between tenth and eleventh grade, I created a poster design to be sold as merchandise for a fan-created zine for the album, "Spirit Phone" by Lemon Demon. My piece was inspired by vintage comic book covers, and represents a song called, "No-Eyed Girl." From this experience, I established connections with a publishing company and sold my artwork for the first time. Additionally, I worked alongside many other artists and made friends along the way. Overall, I enjoyed designing merchandise, and I would love to design merchandise again in the future.</p>
