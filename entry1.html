		<h1>Addressing the Individual Role Project: How I Grew from the Experience</h1>
		<p>During the Individual Role project, students attempted to answer the Driving Question, “What is an individual’s role in society?” To prepare for this task, students read a variety of philosophical literature, researched their community, and optionally, read an outside source. However, the project specifically focused on two philosophies— individualism and collectivism. The definition of each philosophy is subjective, but there are two commonly agreed-upon definitions— individualism is the focus of one’s own needs over the needs of the community. Collectivism is the opposite; instead, collectivism focuses on the needs of the community above oneself. The Individual Role Project spanned three tasks, including an essay, a creative interpretation of the content, and an oral presentation. As with all projects, none of these tasks came without challenge. Over the course of this year, but through this project specifically, I have overcome many obstacles; these challenges have built my character and improved my skills overall.</p>
	<p>While writing the essay, students were to write about the subject objectively; this means that students could not inject their own opinions into the piece, as it only focused on the opinions of society as a whole. In order to achieve this, students wrote about two class readings— one fictional, the other not— as well as community data. Optionally, students could choose to discuss an outside opinion. In writing my essay, I chose as many diverse sources as possible. To accomplish this, I found an outside source that explored the neutral side of the philosophical dichotomy. In my essay, I discussed four perspectives: pro-collectivism, pro-individualism, agreeing with both philosophies, and disagreeing with both philosophies. However, my decision in these sources was not made easily. Initially, I had difficulty approaching the project’s Driving Question. For the first few workdays, little work was completed, because I did not understand the essay’s topic. My mind fixated onto what I thought was impossible; however, with peer support and self-advocation, I was able to successfully answer the question. I asked friends, as well as my teacher, for clarification on the project. Admitting that I needed help getting started was the first thing I needed to do to write the essay successfully. To start the project, I wrote an outline of the essay based on a provided template. I used it to arrange my ideas into a cohesive composition, as well as to keep track of sources and quotes. The document shows that I was able to answer the Driving Question successfully. Overall, my most important growth from this task was furthering my self-advocacy skills. If I had never voiced concerns with my peers, my essay would not have been as effective.</p>
<p>For the second task of the Individual Role project, the creative interpretation, I encountered many hurdles. However, these struggles were not related to the content of my interpretation; instead, my issues lay in the format of the final product. Sometimes, catastrophe in a project can be unpredictable; maybe a file is corrupted, or drafts are lost. In my case, I had to start from scratch. I initially created a poster to represent the opposite philosophies, however, three days before the deadline, disaster struck. I had been using my graphics tablet to create my posters; by the time issues arose, the first poster was nearly complete. After returning to work over a long weekend, I reconnected the tablet to my laptop. Seconds later, it disconnected. I restarted drivers, unplugged and re-inserted the cord, and even restarted my computer, but the tablet did not connect to the laptop. At that point, I had no time to troubleshoot or order any new hardware. In doing so, the only solution I saw was to go in a completely different direction. As such, I hatched my plan; I was to present a TED Talk about the topic, instead. In three days, I created a 16-slide PowerPoint presentation to present to the class. The PowerPoint covered my opinions on the topic, as well as how it relates to current politics. Overall, the most important takeaway was my ability to adapt to new circumstances. Rather than a month to work on my product, I had three days. Despite the rocky start, I was able to pull together a cohesive final product. In doing so, I developed adaptability skills; I persevered through a last-minute technological error with the ability to adapt my ideas into a different format. </p>
<p>The third task, the oral presentation, was the last component of the project. As previously mentioned, I created a TED Talk to present how social issues related to the project topic. I decided upon that topic, because for the entirety of the project’s first task, I remember talking to my friends about how to apply each philosophy to modern identity politics. I thought about how an individualist society— one where collaboration and helping others is second only to one’s desires— would affect disabled communities. I also thought about how hiring discrimination and lack of social opportunities could prevent “productivity” in a collectivist society.  How would everyone truly “work together” if others cannot work? How does “productivity” come at the expense of minorities experiencing workplace discrimination? With those questions in mind, I created an in-depth presentation. It discussed many things; I brought up obscure philosophers, the effects of late-stage capitalism, and systemic oppression. However, my issues arose when I realized how the audience of the TED Talk would react. I knew that many of my peers disagreed with my ideas— such is the nature of political discussions. However, knowing that made me anxious. I presented my TED Talk a few days later. As soon as I stood to present my heavily decorated PowerPoint, I realized that no matter the topic, there was someone bound to disagree. Everyone was going to have their own opinions, and I was given the opportunity to express my own. If this truly was my only time to express the importance of inclusivity in a classroom setting, then I was going to so convincingly and confidently. That revelation got me through the presentation. In the end, it was my own passion in the topic that saved me. I presented the project with great confidence, as I was finally given a platform to discuss something important to me. Overall, overcoming the associated anxieties when discussing difficult topics instilled greater confidence within me about my public speaking skills.</p>
<p>The Individual Role project served as a wake-up call for the skills I needed to develop for success in tenth grade. During the course of the month-long project, I developed my self-advocacy skills, my adaptability skills, and my confidence in my work overall. From this experience, I will be able to produce higher-quality work, and I will be able to present that work more confidently. In the future, I hope to grow these skills more so that I may be more prepared to work in professional environments; many professional jobs require confidence in public speaking, self-advocacy, and the ability to adapt to sudden change. As a result, this project has better prepared me for professional work. In the future, I hope to develop these skills further.
