						<p>Walt Disney, the founder of the Disney Corporation, once said “If you can dream it, you can do it.” This quote relates to creativity. It does so because it perpetuates the idea that the use of the imagination is almost crucial when doing something. Creativity is the use of the imagination or original ideas. In Mr. Lawler’s 7th grade World History class, we had to use our creativity to make a board game. Because I have grown in the quality of creativity, I have improved my skills in game design.</p>
			
						<p>Creativity is a skill I use often. I use these skills in artistic works, coding, writing, and now, game design. In this World History project, we were to create a board game based upon feudalism and the manor system. We had to include all aspects of the manor system and feudalism, have good craftsmanship, and include references to other events we've researched.(i.e The Bubonic Plague.) Feudalism was the dominant government in Medieval Europe. Kings would give fiefs [parts] of land to nobles in exchange for goods. Nobles would give fiefs of their fiefs to knights in exchange for protection. Knights would give housing to servants to maintain crops. The manor system is a system where a lord would house peasants in exchange for labor. In my group, we made a game in which the player, a noble, would try to gain the most land. You could gain land by giving the king payments, by attacking other players, or by deploying cards. Because you own a fief from the king, you must pay him back. Every three turns, each player must give seventy crops and five knights. If you fail to pay these debts when told, you’re out of the game. Our final game board was similar to what I envisioned. Except, of course, it was better than I imagined. I used my creativity skills to brainstorm cards, while my group accepted or rejected my ideas. We ended up with a lot of cards, each involving the Manor System or Feudalism. </p>
						
						<p>Though I only made the game boards and land squares, I created the actual concept of the game. We shared our game ideas, and my design was chosen. I used the <em>Board Game Strategic Plan packet</em> to create a blueprint of the game I envisioned thus far, and I discussed ideas with my group when something needed improvement. We used this packet to plan our ideas for each requirement. I drew the blueprint for the project, which you can see to the left. We created a board game we were all happy with. I used my creativity skills to envision it, and helped my group members create it. I grew in my game design skills because I learned ways to make a successful board game. However, when we actually got comments about how our game was difficult to play. Though our board game was confusing, I can learn from my mistakes when further creating games. When something didn’t work, we discussed ways we could solve the problem. </p>
						
						<p>This year, I have improved in the quality of creativity, which has helped me to become more skilled in game design. Though when I began this project, I didn’t have any experience or knowledge in game design. However, I was able to use my creativity skills to create a game that was fun to play and taught people about the manor system and feudalism. I plan to further these skills and revise my previous attempts at making a game. I’ll also have to use my creativity skills in my artistic work. To me, a creative concept is better than a good execution. </p>
