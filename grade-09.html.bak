				Using the Unreal engine to create a video game level representing a history unit was not as difficult as one might anticipate. The Unreal 
				engine is a software used to develop video games in visual scripting. In Unreal, we created museums representing what we learned so far. The 
				museums went over our women's history, industrialization, progressivism, and African-American history units. I combined my prior knowledge of 
				programs like Blender and Photoshop to create a representation of my knowledge in US History. I define my success in this project by my lack 
				of difficulty understanding the new content and for being proud of my final product.
				</p>
				<p>
				If one were to look at my final screen recording of my museum, it is evident that I was able to create an impressive museum in terms of 
				design. I took inspiration from modern architecture styles, like brutalism, to design the layout of my museum. I modeled special assets to 
				use in my museum, and I took advantage of free assets in the Unreal Store. Truthfully, I knew how to use modeling software because I use it 
				when creating custom content for The Sims 4. I modeled my own assets and imported them into the game. With that knowledge, I knew I was able 
				to succeed in a project like this; I was . When one’s personal interests align with STEM attributes, projects become easier, even if they are 
				unorthodox.

					The Automoblox Car Project is a project in which students reverse-engineer a wooden car in Autodesk Inventor. It is a group project; 
					students choose cars to rebuild based on difficulty. In the project, students start by drafting a sketch of each part. Then, the group 
					begins recreating the car in Inventor; as they progress, they begin to create the other necessary files: assemblies (file highlighting 
					multiple parts and their relationships), dimensioned multi-views (detailed sketches of a part for reproduction), and the final 
					presentation, which is the animated assembly showing how each part fits together. Personally, the struggle permeated in this project was 
					caused by struggles with my partner, lack of understanding of Inventor, my own struggles with perfectionism and expectations, and 
					technical issues. My partner and I both did well on the project; however, in terms of communicating to each other, we did poorly. We had 
					several issues communicating our measurement results; this caused issues when I began transferring his work into an assembly file; none 
					of the edges were properly aligned, causing both of us to have to adjust our files. In creating my files, I spent over fourteen hours 
					over a few days finishing my car. I had to recreate one of my pieces three times before I got it right. We were supposed to connect the 
					windshield of the car to the middle part using insert and mate constraints. However, I ran into issues with clipping and errors; Inventor 
					refused to connect the two parts. To fix this, I learned about tangent constraints, allowing me to constrain my car. Whenever I asked for 
					help, people complained about my workflow. I did not create my part as one should have, and finding useful advice was difficult. Using my 
					skills in creativity, I applied everything I thought could have worked to find a solution to my problems.

					However, when I received my grade, my grade was nearly perfect. Mr. Bottelier personally complimented my car’s accuracy to the real 
					model; he said it was one of the most accurate cars he had seen so far. That means this was a success, right? No, unfortunately not. The 
					expectations described were different from the actual expectations. I graded myself along the rubric as I worked, and often found I would 
					have barely passed. That is because my teachers’ standards and my own standards are different; I berated myself for not matching a slight 
					angle on one part of the front piece, but I received no points off for it. I only submitted my final draft after realizing it was not 
					worth stressing over, and that I would rather deal with imperfections than a late grade on such a large project. Sometimes, one would 
					need to take risks; I did when I finally submitted my car project folder.

					The Apocalypse Anthology project in Language Arts was a group project in which students collaborated on a series of short stories in the 
					same location; students were required to involve their group members’ characters in their own stories as side characters. The group then 
					assembled their stories into an e-book, which was then formatted in PowerPoint. After developing our characters, we wrote about them in a 
					running document based on prompts. Each prompt was followed by a reflection about what we changed and why. I used these documents to 
					outline my ideas to find what worked with the characters and what did not. These first stories allowed me to develop an understanding of 
					the setting and character dynamics. It allowed me to experiment with different perspectives and writing styles. Writing in this style 
					also taught me a better way to organize my thoughts; I knew what changes I made and why. Because of this, the original drafts and the 
					final drafts differ drastically. Comparing the two documents, it is clear that I have grown in my writing skills. In the time between the 
					two drafts, I learned about and applied skills regarding sentence structure, grammar, writing scenes, and developing dialogue. The skills 
					I learned in completing this project will help me when I write in the future, whether that be fiction or nonfiction. I expect that in 
					tenth grade, writing skills will be of utmost importance, furthering the importance of my growth this year.

					Compared to August, I have become more self-reliant; as mentioned previously, I had the same expectations in middle school. However, from 
					the sheer amount of projects this year, I was able to break from that shell. Though I expected a greater workload this year, it was 
					harder than I imagined producing quality work. For this reason, I have grown the most in creativity. In many projects, resourcefulness 
					might as well have been a requirement; in the Car project, I had to diverge from the ways we were taught to solve my problems. In the 
					Apocalypse Anthology project, I was able to learn to think differently, allowing growth in creativity. I was able to excel in the Unreal 
					project specifically because I was creative in my use of prior knowledge. This year, I have developed my own work ethic in order to 
					prepare for the workload next year. In tenth grade, I want to achieve great things. I aim for better time management, grades, and 
					relationships with my peers. I hope to maintain a 4.0 GPA next year, too. With the things I have learned in ninth grade, I feel ready to 
					accomplish these goals.
