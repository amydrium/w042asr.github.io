				Throughout this year, I have grown the most in my 3D modeling skills in Game Design class. I have spent the past three years learning 3D modeling, but this year, I have grown the most in my understanding of intermediate skills, such as rigging models, animation, and physics simulations in a program called Blender; additionally, I learned how to apply best practices to my work. By practicing 3D modeling in Game Design, I have also significantly decreased the amount of time I spend modeling—I now work more efficiently.</p>

				<p>
				My first artifact is a gramophone I modeled in 9th grade for the Virtual History Museum project in US History class; I had little understanding of how 3D modeling worked at the time, and as a result, the model is of poor quality. Some of the most important best practices I have learned since creating this model include consistent topology and modeling in quads. Consistent topology means that each polygon in a model is roughly the same size, or at the very least, that the topology flows well. To model in quads is to only create models with rectangular faces; generally, other than quads, “tris” (triangular faces) are also acceptable, but they are generally avoided. Additionally, this model is made from the shape tools within Blender; it was not modeled by hand for the most part.</p>

				<p>
				My second artifact is a model of an ottoman I made in tenth grade for a class demonstration in Game Design I. Though it is an improvement in many regards, it still is not my best work. I sculpted the creases in the fabric myself, but they look sloppy upon inspection, and the topology is still not fully consistent.</p>
				
				<p>
				My third artifact is my most recent work in Game Design II. Starting in late third quarter, I began working individually to develop a portfolio showcasing my 3D modeling skills for use in college applications. This artifact is my first attempt at 3D animation; I created a walk cycle of a character I modeled in December last year. In working on this two-week long miniature project, I learned how to rig models for animation, how to use physics simulations to model clothing, and how to create simple looping animations. Throughout this process, I also learned a better method to UV unwrap models (preparing models for image textures.) </p>
				
				
				<p>Overall, my growth in 3D modeling this year will help me in developing a work portfolio to use when applying to colleges next year. By learning these skills now, I will be better prepared for potentially pursuing 3D animation as a career in the future.</p>
